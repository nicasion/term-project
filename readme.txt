Readme File [5 pts]
You must include a new file, readme.txt, which should include the following components:

A short description of the project's name and what it does. This may be taken from your design docs.

How to run the project. For example, which file the user should run in an editor. If your project uses data/source files, also describe how the user should set those up.

How to install any needed libraries. If you can include the library in the submission, that is preferred.

A list of any shortcut commands that exist. Shortcut commands can be used to demonstrate specific features by skipping forward in a game or loading sample data. They're useful for when you're testing your code too!

A competent programmer should be able to run your project after reading the readme file, so make sure to include all necessary files in your submission!
